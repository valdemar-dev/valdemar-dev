Full stack developer of 6+ years.  
My expertise is in full-stack development, creating rich and varied experiences for users.  

## Elegance.JS
For long I've felt that the field of web development was deeply flawed.  
Elegance is my attempt at fixing it.  
It's an open-source, compiled, fully typescript, minimally dependent, highly opinionated, and most importantly fast, full-stack web-framework.
