# Valdemar
Hello!  
I'm a, 18 year old programming student from :flag_fi: Finland.  
I'm currently majoring in **Full-Stack Web-Development**.  
  
Some of my passions include:  
 - Learning
 - Psychology
 - Physics
 - Philosophy
 - Music
 - Programming (lots of it)


## ðŸ“– Languages
### JavaScript
JS was the first language I learnt over 6 years ago now (I quickly regretted it).  
I started doing just simple console applications, however I quickly moved to full-stack web applications.  
My most recent project was in TypeScript and was a simple matchmaking app, akin to tinder.  
It used NextJS, Postgres, Tailwind, Socket.io and much more.  
**Note:** I've omitted HTML, CSS and TS here for brevity, but I know those too.  
#### JS/TS Projects:
  - [Beta Version of the Matchmaking Website done as a Discord Bot](https://github.com/valdemar-dev/isolationism-match-bot)
  - [Helper Bot in TS for one of my Discord Servers](https://github.com/valdemar-dev/iso-helpy)
  - [Super Rudimentary Password Manager That does actually encrypt your stuff](https://github.com/valdemar-dev/passmngr)

### Python
Python was the second language I learnt, a little over 4 years ago. I never really got too into it.  
I did make some fun text-based adventure games, but those have been lost to time.  
Further on I may use Python for some machine learning if I ever bother to jump on that train.  

### Kotlin
I learnt kotlin around 7 months ago, primarily to try full-on OOP. (JS doesn't count)  
It was a fun language, and I made a basic Web-Server, and played around with LibGDX to create some games.  
I did not *finish* a game, because I realised my lack of graphics programming was jarring, and abstractions weren't going to help.  

### C/C++
I started learning C around 2 months ago at the time of writing this, and it's honestly the best.  
I chose C because OpenGL. (and I'd never tried full on functional programming either)  
I will eventually make a simple Isometric 3D Survival game set in space using just C and OpenGL, however that's probably for next year.  
#### C/C++ Projects:
  - [Matrix-Matrix Multiplicator](https://github.com/valdemar-dev/matrix-multiplicator)
  - [Implementing the LearnOpenGL Book](https://github.com/valdemar-dev/learn-opengl)
  
-# Please note that the majority of my currently deployed code is closed-source. However, as projects become obsolete, I tend to open-source them.
