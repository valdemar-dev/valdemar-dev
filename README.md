### Hello! 👋🏻
I'm an 18 year old programming student from 🇫🇮 Finland.  
I'm currently majoring in **Full-Stack Web-Development**.  
  
**I'm passionate about**:  
 - 📕 Learning
 - 🧠 Psychology
 - ⚛️ Physics
 - ⚖️ Philosophy
 - 🎶 Music
 - 🏛️ Politics
 - 🖥️ Programming

## 📖 Languages
### JavaScript
**JS** was the first language I learnt over 6 years ago now (I quickly regretted it).  
I started doing just simple console applications, however I quickly moved to full-stack web applications.  
My most recent project was in TypeScript and was a simple matchmaking app, akin to tinder.  
It used **NextJS**, **Postgres**, **Tailwind**, **Socket.io** and much more.  
**Note:** I've omitted **HTML**, **CSS** and **TS** here for brevity, but I know those too.  
#### JS/TS Projects:
  - [Beta Version of the Matchmaking Website done as a Discord Bot](https://github.com/valdemar-dev/isolationism-match-bot)
  - [Helper Bot in TS for one of my Discord Servers](https://github.com/valdemar-dev/iso-helpy)
  - [Super Rudimentary Password Manager That does actually encrypt your stuff](https://github.com/valdemar-dev/passmngr)

### Python
**Python** was the second language I learnt, a little over 4 years ago. I never really got too into it.  
I did make some fun text-based adventure games, but those have been lost to time.  
In the future I may use **Python** for some machine learning if I ever bother to jump on that train.  

### Kotlin
I learnt **Kotlin** around 7 months ago, primarily to try full-on OOP. (**JS** doesn't count)  
It was a fun language, and I made a basic Web-Server, and played around with **LibGDX** to create some games.  
I did not *finish* a game, because I realised my lack of graphics programming was jarring, and abstractions weren't going to help.  

### C/C++
I started learning **C** around 2 months ago at the time of writing this, and it's fantastic!.  
I chose **C** because **OpenGL**. (and I'd never tried full on functional programming either)  
I will eventually make a simple Isometric 3D Survival game set in space using just **C** and **OpenGL**, however that's probably for next year.  
#### C/C++ Projects:
  - [Matrix-Matrix Multiplicator](https://github.com/valdemar-dev/matrix-multiplicator)
  - [Implementing the LearnOpenGL Book](https://github.com/valdemar-dev/learn-opengl)
  
Please note that the majority of my currently deployed code is closed-source. However, as projects become obsolete, I tend to open-source them.
